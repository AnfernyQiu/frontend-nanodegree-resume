This is my project of nanodegree-resume. All of my work is done by refering to the guide of this project.
All of JS codes have pass the jshint and all of JSON data have pass JSON validator. The JSON for each resume section has followed the provided data schema exactly.
All the functions are encapsulated in JSON object.
All codes have been beautified, no whitespace, no trailingspace etc.
